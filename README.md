# Doordash-Dasher-Earnings-Analysis

This project uses data from a variety of sources to evaluate the variables that contribute most to a dasher's earnings potential. It is important to note the limitations of this analysis. The data is from a single US-based dasher from a short span of 14 weeks of working as a contract driver for Doordash.

The conclusions derived from analysis are not intended to inform business decisions. The purpose of this project is to showcase my technical knowledge of common techniques used in data science. This includes collecting, compiling, and cleaning data, exploratory data analysis, performing statisitcal analysis, as well as building basic machine learning models. It is meant to provide greater insight into my approach to a data analytics problem.
